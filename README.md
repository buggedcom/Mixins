# PHP Mixins

Since PHP 5.4+ we have traits, granted. But traits do not allow the programatic extension of classes functions. Before all the hate starts I know that are many many reason as to why this shouldnt be done, however there are also valid reasons for extending classes like this.

## Example

Open up test.php and find the example script. This version of the mixin uses traits, however there is no reason as to why the main trait class could not be packported into a base class and used to extend your classes as a base.

Any questions, just shoot me an email.
